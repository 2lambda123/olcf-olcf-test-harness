This checked is version is the trunk of the 
production version of the nccs test harness. 
Do not do an update due to the fact one may 
incorporate untested and unstable code.

One would normally create a branch to develop 
code off the trunk but we have an incompatible
repository format with our svn client and we are
unable to do a "svn --reintegrate ... " to merge
the brach back into the trunk.

We will update the svn repo after accepatance.
