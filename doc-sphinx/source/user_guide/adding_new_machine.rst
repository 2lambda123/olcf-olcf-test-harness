Adding a New Machine to the OTH
===============================

The following steps can be used to add support for a new system:

1. Create a machine master configuration (e.g. *lyra.ini*).
2. Update the location of the repository that will hold all applications and tests for that particular machine.
3. Add a new machine to the machine factory (we should probably remove this step).
